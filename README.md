### Dataset

For this project, I used two datasets:

- [Dataset: SAT Scores](./data/sat.csv)
- [Dataset: ACT Scores](./data/act.csv)

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.

### Process
- Utilized basic statistics to analyze SAT and ACT information to figure out what exam is doing better overall and has more students taking it. This was not absolute, however as the analysis was based on the data used and not as much external research. As such, I do understand that given more data I could give a more complete analysis.
